# doc-lattice

A deterministic, offline traceability engine for design and production documentation.

doc-lattice tracks the dependencies *between* your markdown docs. When a downstream
document derives from an upstream one (an integration guide built on an API design, an
engineering design built on a product brief), it records that link in frontmatter. When
the upstream changes, doc-lattice tells you exactly which downstream docs went stale, and a
CI gate keeps stale work from shipping silently.

It is pure tooling: no network (except the optional `linear` command), no secrets, no LLM,
no database. The dependency graph is derived from your docs on demand, never committed.

## The problem it solves

Docs drift apart. Someone changes the API contract, revises a requirement, or reverses an
architecture decision, and the documents downstream of that decision keep citing the old
version. Nothing breaks loudly; the docs just quietly disagree, and the drift surfaces as a
bug, a re-do, or an argument weeks later.

doc-lattice makes those dependencies explicit and *checkable*. Each downstream doc declares
what it derives from and records a hash of what it last saw. A change upstream that the
downstream hasn't acknowledged is **drift**, and `check` fails CI on it until a human
consciously reconciles the link.

## Where it fits

doc-lattice is domain-agnostic: it needs nothing but markdown files with frontmatter. Three
doc sets it fits naturally:

- **Software product docs.** Product briefs feed engineering designs, which feed runbooks
  and integration guides. When a requirement changes, `impact` lists every downstream doc
  that cited it, and `check` keeps the ones that never acknowledged the change from passing
  CI quietly.
- **Game studio design docs** (the project's original home). Art direction, economy tuning,
  and core-loop docs sit upstream of dozens of character, level, and systems specs. One
  retuned economy value can quietly invalidate a season of downstream work; drift detection
  surfaces that the day it happens instead of weeks later in a playtest.
- **Policy and compliance doc sets.** Procedures and checklists derive from a controls
  document or a policy. An unacknowledged upstream edit there is an audit finding waiting to
  happen; a CI gate turns it into a red build instead.

## How it works

You annotate docs with two things:

- **Stable ids.** Every tracked file declares an `id` in its frontmatter. Sections are addressed
  by their heading's GitHub slug by default; an explicit `{#anchor}` tag on the heading provides
  a stable id independent of heading text. Section ids are file-scoped, so the same anchor in
  two files does not collide with file ids or each other.
- **`derives_from` edges.** A downstream doc lists the upstream ids it depends on. Each edge
  carries a `seen` hash: a fingerprint of the upstream content at the moment the dependency
  was last reconciled.

From those annotations doc-lattice builds a **lattice**: an id-indexed graph of nodes
(your docs) and edges (the `derives_from` links). Every command reads from that one
structure. The `seen` hash is the load-bearing trick: comparing it against the upstream's
*current* content hash is what turns "these docs depend on each other" into "this dependency
is out of date."

### Drift states

`check` classifies every edge into one of four states:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **OK** | `seen` matches the upstream's current content. In sync. |
| **STALE** | The upstream changed since `seen` was locked. The downstream needs review. |
| **UNRECONCILED** | The edge has no `seen` yet. The dependency was declared but never acknowledged. |
| **BROKEN** | The ref points at an id that no longer exists. |

The content hash is `sha256` of a *canonicalized* copy of the text, truncated to 128 bits.
Canonicalization normalizes line endings, strips trailing whitespace per line, and trims
leading and trailing blank lines, so those cosmetic edits never trip drift. Internal
whitespace is preserved, so rewrapping a paragraph (which moves its line breaks) does count
as a change.

### Broken refs and tool errors

A ref that points at nothing is a normal, reportable lattice state: `check` calls it BROKEN
and exits 1. Invalid config or lattice frontmatter, unreadable or non-UTF-8 documents,
containment failures, and incoherent ids are tool errors that exit 2. An index is incoherent
when two files repeat a file id or two headings in one file resolve to the same file-scoped
anchor. Equal anchors in different files, and a file id equal to another file's anchor, remain
distinct `TargetId(file_id, anchor)` keys and do not collide.

### The authority ladder

Separately from drift, `lint` enforces a structural rule: authority only flows downhill.
Docs can declare an `authority` of `binding`, `derived`, or `exploratory`. A `derives_from`
edge from a more-authoritative doc to a less-authoritative one is an **inversion** (a binding
spec should not derive from an exploratory sketch), and `lint` fails on it. `lint` is pure
structure, independent of drift, and exits 1 on a violation just like `check`.

## A worked example

Two docs. The upstream owns a decision; the downstream depends on it.

`docs/api-design.md`, the upstream:

```markdown
---
id: api-design
layer: design
authority: binding
---
# API Design

## Pagination {#pagination}
List endpoints use cursor pagination: pass the last item's cursor as `after`.
```

`docs/billing-integration-guide.md`, which derives from the pagination decision:

```markdown
---
id: billing-integration-guide
layer: technical
authority: derived
derives_from:
  - ref: api-design#pagination
    seen: 647cc64481bee8d8541ef7d1733b5204
tickets: [ENG-412]
---
# Billing Integration Guide

Invoice listings page through results with the cursor scheme the API design defines.
```

The ref `api-design#pagination` resolves file-scoped: it points at the section in the
`api-design` file whose heading carries the `{#pagination}` marker. Markers are optional; a
heading with no marker is addressed by its GitHub slug instead, and an explicit marker pins
the id so the ref survives a later rewording of the heading. The `seen` hash records the
pagination text the guide was last built against.

Now someone switches the API to page-number pagination. The `{#pagination}` section's
content hash no longer matches `seen`, so:

```console
$ doc-lattice check
STALE         billing-integration-guide -> api-design#pagination

$ doc-lattice impact api-design#pagination
billing-integration-guide  (/work/acme-api/docs/billing-integration-guide.md)  tickets: ENG-412
```

`check` exits 1, so CI is now red. A human reviews the guide against the new pagination
scheme, updates the body if needed, and then locks in the new hash:

```console
$ doc-lattice reconcile billing-integration-guide
reconciled billing-integration-guide.md: api-design#pagination

$ doc-lattice check
OK            billing-integration-guide -> api-design#pagination
```

That edit → `check` → review → `reconcile` loop is the whole workflow. `reconcile` is the
only command that writes to your docs, and it only ever rewrites the `seen` scalar.

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`)

### Install and run

Run the released CLI without installing it globally:

```bash
uvx doc-lattice --help
```

Or install it into an isolated tool environment:

```bash
uv tool install doc-lattice
doc-lattice --help
```

`pipx install doc-lattice` provides the same isolated installation. A conventional
`python -m pip install doc-lattice` is also supported when installing into an activated virtual
environment.

### Development

```bash
uv sync --group dev
uv run doc-lattice --help
```

### Test

```bash
uv run --group dev pytest          # full suite (enforces coverage >= 80%)
uv run --group dev ruff check src tests
uv run --group dev ty check src
```

## Commands

| Command | What it does | Exits non-zero |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| `check [--only STATE ...] [--format human\|json\|github]` | Classify every `derives_from` edge as OK / STALE / UNRECONCILED / BROKEN. | 1 on drift, 2 on tool error |
| `lint [--format human\|json\|github]` | Validate the authority ladder (binding > derived > exploratory) over the edges. | 1 on a violation, 2 on tool error |
| `impact TOKEN [--depth N]` | List every downstream doc affected by a change to TOKEN; `--depth N` bounds the walk to N hops. | 2 on tool error |
| `reconcile [ID] [--ref REF] [--all] [--dry-run]` | Set `seen` to current upstream hashes for the selected edges (the only command that mutates your tracked docs); `--dry-run` previews the plan without writing. | 2 on tool error |
| `graph [--format mermaid\|dot\|json]` | Emit the edge graph as Mermaid, DOT, or JSON. | 2 on tool error (including an unrecognized `--format`) |
| `linear [TARGET] [--from ID] [--exit-code] [--warn-exit]` | Report tickets shipped against a spec that has since drifted (needs `LINEAR_API_KEY`). | 1 with `--exit-code` on DANGER/BLOCKED (or WARNING too under `--warn-exit`), 2 on tool error |
| `init [--docs-root ...] [--linear-team KEY]` | Scaffold `.doc-lattice.yml` and print pre-commit and CI codegen. | 2 on tool error |

Only `check` and `lint` gate by default, exiting 1 when they find drift or an authority inversion.
`impact`, `reconcile`, `graph`, and `init` are informational and always exit 0 on success (2 only on
a tool error), so wiring `impact` into a CI gate never turns the build red. `linear` also exits 0 by
default; pass `--exit-code` to gate on any DANGER or BLOCKED finding, and add `--warn-exit` to gate on
WARNING as well.

Every command except `init` accepts `--config PATH` (path to `.doc-lattice.yml`; defaults to
the file in the current directory). `check`, `lint`, `impact`, `reconcile`, and `linear` accept
`--json` for machine-readable output. Run `uv run doc-lattice <command> --help` for the full
flag list.

Pass `--indent N` with JSON output on `check`, `lint`, `impact`, or `linear` to pretty-print the
JSON with `N` spaces per level. JSON output is selected by `--json`, or the equivalent
`--format json` on `check` and `lint`; `--indent` without JSON output is a usage error.

Use the global `--no-color` option before the command to disable colored output explicitly, for
example `doc-lattice --no-color check`. Rich also honors the [`NO_COLOR`](https://no-color.org/)
environment variable; `--no-color` is the command-line equivalent. Either one also strips the
styling from help and usage-error text even when a terminal-forcing variable is set.

`check` and `lint` also accept `--format human|json|github`. `human` is the default, and `json`
is equivalent to the existing `--json` alias. `github` emits one escaped GitHub Actions `::error`
workflow command per drift finding or ladder violation, each with a repo-relative file path, so
findings attach inline to the offending doc in the pull-request diff. Output selection never
changes gate exit codes. Do not combine `--json` with `--format github`.

`impact` walks the full transitive closure by default. Pass `--depth N` (N >= 1) to bound the
walk to N hops from TOKEN: `--depth 1` lists only the docs that derive directly from it. Human
output is unchanged, and each `--json` entry gains a `"depth"` field carrying the minimum number
of hops at which that doc is reached.

`check` accepts a repeatable `--only STATE` to narrow the display to specific states (case
insensitive, e.g. `--only stale --only broken`); an unrecognized state exits 2 and names the
valid set. Filtering is display-only: the exit code always reflects every edge, so `check --only
OK` on a drifting lattice still exits 1.

### `reconcile` selectors

`reconcile` needs either a downstream id or `--all` (running it with neither is an error):

- **`reconcile DOWNSTREAM_ID`**: reconcile every drifting edge of one downstream node.
- **`reconcile DOWNSTREAM_ID --ref REF`**: narrow to a single upstream ref on that node, selected
  by resolved identity; refused if it targets a BROKEN edge.
- **`reconcile --all`**: clear every STALE/UNRECONCILED edge in the lattice. Skips BROKEN and
  already-OK edges, and skips a node's broken edge rather than failing the node, so one dangling
  ref never blocks the rest.
- **`reconcile --all --ref REF`**: reconcile matching drifting edges across every downstream
  node. Nonmatching, BROKEN, and already-OK edges are skipped; unlike the single-node form, no
  match is a successful no-op.

`reconcile` re-reads each downstream file fresh at write time, rewrites only the targeted `seen`
scalar through round-trip YAML (preserving your body, key order, and comments), and validates all
rewrites before mutation. Edits present during that fresh-read validation are preserved, but an
edit racing after validation may be overwritten. It atomically replaces each file, but a
multi-file run is not transactional: if a later replacement fails, earlier replacements remain.

Add `--dry-run` to any of the selectors above to preview the plan without writing: it prints
`would reconcile FILE: REF` per edge that would change (`nothing to reconcile` if none would),
and leaves every file byte-identical. Combine with `--json` for a machine-readable plan:
`{"dry_run": true, "reconciled": [{"path": ..., "ref": ..., "new_seen": ...}]}`, sorted by path
then ref. A real run with `--json` emits the same shape with `"dry_run": false`, after the
writes complete.

## Frontmatter reference

| Key | Where | Meaning |
|-----|-------|---------|
| `id` | every tracked file | The file's stable id. Required. |
| `title` | optional | Display title. |
| `layer` | optional | `design`, `technical`, or `production`. |
| `authority` | optional | `binding`, `derived`, or `exploratory`. Ranked by `lint`. |
| `derives_from` | downstream files | List of `{ ref, seen }` edges. |
| `derives_from[].ref` | each edge | The upstream id: bare (whole-file target, e.g. `api-design`) or file-scoped (section target, e.g. `api-design#pagination`). |
| `derives_from[].seen` | each edge | The locked upstream hash, or omitted for a never-reconciled (UNRECONCILED) edge. |
| `tickets` | optional | Issue ids associated with the doc (used by `impact` and `linear`). |

Section ids are optional: a heading is addressed by its GitHub slug by default (e.g.
`## Error Handling` resolves to `error-handling`). An explicit marker must be the trailing heading
token and match `{#[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]*}`; a whitespace-separated ATX closing sequence may
follow it (e.g. `## Error Handling {#errors} ##`). A valid marker supplies the stable anchor
independent of heading text. Invalid or nontrailing marker-like text is ordinary heading content,
so the heading falls back to its generated GitHub slug. Section refs are file-scoped
(`file#anchor`), so the same anchor in two files does not collide.

## Configuration

doc-lattice runs zero-config (defaulting to a `docs/` root), or reads `.doc-lattice.yml`
from the current directory:

```yaml
# doc-lattice configuration
docs_roots:
  - docs                  # roots to scan for tracked .md files (default: ["docs"])
# ignore_globs:           # paths to skip within those roots
#   - "**/superpowers/plans/**"
# cache_key: my-docs      # opt-in incremental load cache slot (see Load cache below)
# cache_trust_stat: false # opt-in stat fast tier for read-only commands (accepts the mtime caveat)
# linear_team: ENG        # the Linear team the `linear` query targets
# binding_layers: null    # accepted but inert today; setting it changes nothing (see below)
```

The project root is the resolved parent of the selected config file, including an explicit
`--config PATH`, or the resolved current directory in zero-config mode. Relative `docs_roots`
entries are interpreted from that project root. Every root must resolve inside it; an entry that
escapes via `..`, an absolute path, or a symlink is rejected before any read.

Discovered document symlinks are resolved separately. A symlink whose target stays inside the
project root is allowed, while one targeting anything outside is skipped with a warning. If
multiple roots or symlink aliases resolve to the same document, it is loaded once under the first
unresolved path discovered. Reconcile re-resolves that identity path before writing so a retargeted
symlink cannot escape the project root.

`binding_layers` is accepted in the config for forward compatibility but is inert today: setting it
changes nothing, because no command consults it. Authority ranking currently lives entirely in
`lint` (binding > derived > exploratory); the
[lint design spec](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-28-doc-lattice-lint-design.md) preserves
historical design context for that ranking.

### Load cache (opt-in)

Large doc sets (thousands of files) can skip re-parsing unchanged docs with an opt-in cache.
Set `cache_key` to a single safe segment (`^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,63}$`); it names a slot
under your user cache home at `<cache_home>/doc-lattice/<cache_key>/load-cache.json`, where
`<cache_home>` is `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` (when absolute) or `~/.cache`. The cache lives outside every
checkout on purpose: because `.doc-lattice.yml` is committed, every clone and git worktree of the
project shares one warm cache with no per-checkout setup, which an in-repo cache could not do.

By default the cache re-reads and re-hashes each file's bytes every run, so its output is always
byte-identical to an uncached run under any cache state (cold, warm, stale, structurally corrupt, or
wrong version); only timing differs. A structurally corrupt cache (unreadable, non-JSON, wrong
version, or schema-invalid) is discarded wholesale and rebuilt; the cache is a trusted single-writer
file under your own cache home, so it is not hardened against hand-edited tampering that stays
schema-valid. Setting `cache_trust_stat: true` adds a faster tier for read-only commands that trusts
a file whose size and modification time are unchanged, accepting that the file is not opened at all:
a rewrite that preserves both its size and its nanosecond mtime is served stale, and a file made
unreadable (for example a permissions change, which does not alter size or mtime) is served from
cache instead of erroring, each until the file is touched. `reconcile` ignores `cache_trust_stat`
and always verifies content, so it can never write frontmatter from stale data.
`cache_trust_stat: true` requires `cache_key`; otherwise config loading is a tool error and exits 2.
Two projects sharing a `cache_key` stay correct (a content-hash
hit implies identical bytes); the only cost is overwrite churn, so prefer distinct keys. Delete the
cache directory to reset it; a tool-version bump discards it automatically.

Any cache read failure, including an unreadable, invalid, or stale cache file, silently falls back
to rebuilding from documents. A cache write failure emits one stderr diagnostic and is otherwise
ignored: it does not change command results or exit codes.

## Adopting doc-lattice in your docs repo

Bootstrap config and the drift and authority-ladder gates for a repo whose docs you want to
track:

```bash
uvx --python 3.13 --from doc-lattice==1.0.1 doc-lattice init
```

This writes `.doc-lattice.yml` (only if absent) and prints pre-commit hooks and a GitHub
Actions workflow that run `doc-lattice check` (drift) and `doc-lattice lint` (authority
ladder) as your gates. Paste each where the output says. Pass `--docs-root` (repeatable) or
`--linear-team` to bake those values into the generated config.
The generated gates remain fully offline: they run only `check` and `lint` and do not require or
receive `LINEAR_API_KEY`.

To test an unreleased commit, replace the PyPI requirement with a Git source such as
`--from git+https://github.com/Guardantix/doc-lattice@<commit>`; released configurations should
keep the exact PyPI version pin.

## Linear integration

`doc-lattice linear` is the only network-touching command. It builds a trigger map from the
loaded lattice, then fetches live ticket status over the Linear GraphQL API to report tickets
that shipped against a spec that has since drifted. It reads `LINEAR_API_KEY` from the
environment (export it before running; the error points you to `impact` for the offline view),
and the client is https-only, redirect-refusing, size-capped, and SSRF-hardened. A transient
HTTP 429 or 5xx gets two retries, for three total attempts. Without a usable `Retry-After`, retries
wait 1 second and then 2 seconds. A non-negative integer `Retry-After` is honored up to the
30-second cap; negative, date-form, and invalid values use the fallback delay.

> **Security note:** If `linear` is used in CI, run it only on trusted refs and never in a fork
> pull-request job, whether or not `--exit-code` is used. The command processes
> repository-controlled `tickets` and `linear_team` while `LINEAR_API_KEY` is present. Fork
> pull-request workflows should use the offline `check`, `lint`, and `impact` commands instead.

Canonical ticket ids are uppercase ASCII `TEAM-NUMBER`: `TEAM` starts with an uppercase letter
and continues with uppercase letters or digits, while `NUMBER` is `0` or a decimal with no leading
zeros. One `linear` run accepts at most 500 distinct ticket refs after its positional or `--from`
scope is applied. Set the team the query targets with `linear_team` in `.doc-lattice.yml`, or pass
`--linear-team` to `init`. Every other command runs fully offline.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success; no drift or violations. |
| `1` | The lattice is coherent but a gate failed: drift (`check`), an authority inversion (`lint`), or (with `--exit-code`) a DANGER/BLOCKED `linear` finding. |
| `2` | Tool error: invalid config/frontmatter, unreadable or non-UTF-8 input, incoherent ids, or a containment failure. |

## Troubleshooting

**`LINEAR_API_KEY is not set`.** Only the `linear` command needs a key. Export a Linear API key
(`export LINEAR_API_KEY=lin_api_...`) before running `linear`, or, when live Linear status is
unnecessary, run `impact` instead: `impact` is the fully offline view of the same downstream reach
and needs no key.

**Linear returns HTTP 429 or 5xx.** These are transient. The client makes at most three attempts,
using the 1- and 2-second fallback delays or a capped, non-negative integer `Retry-After`. If it
still fails, the error tells you to wait and re-run; `impact` stays available offline in the
meantime.

**A `linear` finding is BLOCKED `not-found`.** A ticket the Linear filter does not return is treated
as absence, not an error: it grades as a BLOCKED `not-found` finding rather than crashing the
command. Confirm the ticket id exists and that `linear_team` targets the right team.

**`duplicate id ...` exits 2.** A duplicate id makes the index incoherent, so loading the lattice
fails with exit 2 (a tool error, distinct from the exit 1 that `check` and `lint` use for drift).
The message names both registration sites so you can find the clash: either two files share an
`id`, or two headings in one file resolve to the same anchor through equal markers or a marker/slug
collision. Equal anchors in different files do not collide.

The engine is a pure pipeline (`config -> discovery -> frontmatter parse -> build_lattice`
feeding `{ check, impact, reconcile, graph, lint, linear }`) where all graph and report logic
is filesystem-free. `config`, `discovery`, `orchestrate`, and `cli` own high-level filesystem
work; cache I/O is split between document-reading `cache/lookup.py` and cache-file-owning
`cache/store.py`. Only `linear_client` touches the network. See
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the decisions behind that split.
