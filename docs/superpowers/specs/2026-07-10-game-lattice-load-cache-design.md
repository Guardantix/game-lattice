# Opt-In Incremental Load Cache: Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-07-10
**Status:** Proposed (the spec PR for issue #28). Implementation follows as a separate PR
referencing this spec.
**Issue:** GitHub issue #28, `opt-in incremental lattice load cache`.

## 1. Goal and scope

Every command rebuilds the lattice from scratch: discovery re-walks the roots, every doc is
re-read, its frontmatter re-parsed and re-validated, and its TOC, slugs, and spans re-derived.
The binding local-core design deferred a "gitignored performance cache" as not needed at the
original corpus size. This spec adds that cache for adopters whose doc sets have grown to the
thousands, as a pure accelerator with an absolute correctness guarantee:

> Under the default tier configuration (`cache_trust_stat` absent or false): for every
> command, under any cache state (`cache_key` unset, cold, warm, stale, corrupt, wrong
> version), stdout, stderr, exit code, and any file mutations are byte-identical to an
> uncached run. Only timing and the contents of the cache file may differ.
>
> Under `cache_trust_stat: true`, file mutations keep the full guarantee unconditionally
> (`reconcile` always verifies content, section 5), and read-only command output keeps it
> except in exactly one documented case: a file rewritten so that both its size and its
> `mtime_ns` are unchanged is served stale until it is touched or misses.

`cache_trust_stat` is therefore not a hidden weakening of the contract; it is the contract's
one explicit, opt-in narrowing, it can never alter what the tool writes to disk, and the issue
sketch anticipated it as "accepting the standard mtime caveat and documenting it".

The single stated output exception is one diagnostic line on stderr when the cache file itself
cannot be written (section 7), which exists only when the cache is broken and never changes
command results or exit codes.

Out of scope: watch mode, a daemon, cross-machine cache sharing, and everything in section 11.

## 2. Config surface

Two new optional keys in `Config` (`.game-lattice.yml`):

- `cache_key: str | null = null`. Absent or null disables caching entirely; the load path is
  bit-for-bit today's. When set, it names the cache slot under the user-level cache home
  (section 3). Validated by a pydantic field validator as a single safe path segment:
  `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]{0,63}$`. The leading character class rejects `.` and `..` and
  hidden-directory names; there is no way to express a separator or a traversal. A violation
  is a `ConfigError` (exit 2) naming the key and the allowed pattern.
- `cache_trust_stat: bool = false`. Enables the stat fast tier (section 5) for read-only
  commands; `reconcile` ignores it and always verifies content. Setting it without
  `cache_key` is a `ConfigError` naming the fix, keeping the config strict and explicit.

No CLI flag controls the cache in v1. Opt-in and opt-out are config-only.

## 3. Cache location: why a key, not a path

The issue sketch proposed an in-repo `cache_dir` contained by `safe_resolve`. That placement
fails the dominant workflow: work happens in per-task git worktrees. A gitignored in-repo cache
starts cold in every new worktree, so the warm case rarely materializes; a committed cache
violates the binding design's rule that the derived graph is never committed and would be
constant rebase churn. The cache therefore lives outside every checkout:

```
<cache_home>/game-lattice/<cache_key>/load-cache.json
```

where `<cache_home>` is `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` when that variable is set to an absolute path
(a relative value is ignored, per the XDG base directory spec), and `~/.cache` otherwise.
The directory is created on first write. Because `.game-lattice.yml` is committed, every
clone and every worktree of the project shares one warm cache with zero per-checkout setup.

This supersedes the issue's `safe_resolve` containment bullet with a stricter rule:
the config carries no path semantics at all. `cache_key` is one validated segment, so
containment holds by construction and a hostile config can write nothing outside
`<cache_home>/game-lattice/`.

Two different projects configured with the same `cache_key` remain correct: a content-hash hit
implies identical bytes and therefore identical derivations, and stat records are looked up per
project root (section 4). The collision only causes overwrite churn, which the README notes.

## 4. Cache file and entry schema

One JSON document, version 1:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "tool_version": "0.7.0",
  "roots": ["/abs/path/least-recently-used-root", "/abs/path/most-recently-used-root"],
  "entries": {
    "docs/design/save-format.md": {
      "file_sha256": "<sha256 of the raw file bytes, 64 hex chars>",
      "stats": {
        "/abs/path/to/a/project/root": { "size": 4213, "mtime_ns": 1720512345123456789 }
      },
      "node": {
        "meta": { "...": "validated NodeMeta model_dump(mode='json')" },
        "body": "verbatim decoded text after the closing frontmatter fence",
        "total_lines": 57,
        "sections": [ { "anchor": "slot-table", "start": 10, "end": 22 } ]
      }
    },
    "docs/notes/scratch.md": {
      "file_sha256": "<64 hex chars>",
      "stats": {
        "/abs/path/to/a/project/root": { "size": 90, "mtime_ns": 1720512345000000000 }
      },
      "node": null
    }
  }
}
```

- **Entries are keyed by path relative to the project root** (POSIX separators). The cache is
  therefore independent of `docs_roots` and `ignore_globs`: discovery decides the file set each
  run and the cache is consulted only per discovered file, so config changes need no
  invalidation logic.
- **`tool_version` records the `game_lattice.__version__` that wrote the file**, and any
  mismatch discards the cache wholesale, exactly like a `version` mismatch. A content-hash
  match proves the input bytes are unchanged, not that the derivation logic is unchanged: a
  release that alters the slugger port, a ruamel-yaml upgrade that shifts YAML semantics, or a
  pydantic upgrade that changes validation could all make a cached derivation diverge from a
  fresh parse while `CACHE_VERSION` sits unbumped. Tying invalidation to the release version
  makes that class of staleness impossible at the cost of one cold rebuild per release.
  `CACHE_VERSION` remains for intentional schema changes within a development cycle.
- **`file_sha256` is the full sha256 of the raw file bytes.** It is deliberately not the
  lattice's 32-hex truncated hash of canonicalized text; the name keeps the two from being
  confused. It is the sole authority for entry validity.
- **`stats` maps a project-root realpath to that checkout's `(size, mtime_ns)`** for the file.
  Per-root keying is what lets several worktrees share one cache without ping-ponging each
  other's stat data, and each root key is simultaneously that root's presence claim on the
  path: reclamation (section 5) drops an entry that no live root claims.
- **`roots` is a least-recently-used ledger of project roots, bounded by
  `MAX_STAT_ROOTS = 8`** (a fixed constant in `constants.py`, not configurable). Every run
  moves its own root to the tail at write time; when the ledger exceeds the cap, head roots are
  evicted and their keys scrubbed from every entry's `stats` map in the same write. This bounds
  stat data to at most 8 roots times the tracked files, with no clock and no age heuristic:
  dead worktrees age to the head and are scrubbed by runs from live roots. An evicted root that
  returns simply re-warms through the verify tier. Correctness is never involved; stats are
  only ever a hint beneath the content hash.
- **`node: null` caches the verdict "not a lattice node"** for a discovered file without an
  `id`, so such files skip frontmatter split and YAML parsing on a hit. Non-node entries carry
  no body or sections.
- **`sections` stores exactly what `build_lattice` consumes**: each heading's resolved anchor
  id and inclusive line span, plus `total_lines`. `Heading` objects are not needed after
  anchor and span derivation. Duplicate-anchor detection still happens at registration time
  inside `build_lattice`, so `DuplicateIdError` behavior is identical from cache or fresh parse.
- **Target hashes are deliberately not cached** (a deviation from the issue sketch, evaluated
  and rejected). Issue #25's per-run memoization already bounds that cost to one
  canonicalize-plus-hash per referenced target per run, and pre-seeding the caller-owned memo
  would leak cache state through the pure command layer, since `check` and `reconcile` would
  need cache-aware wiring. If the benchmark shows referenced-target hashing is material at 5k
  docs, adding a field is a clean v2 schema change behind a version bump.
- **Only successful loads are cached.** A file whose frontmatter fails to parse or validate
  aborts the load (exit 2) before any cache write, so errors are never cached and a broken file
  fails identically under any cache state.

## 5. Load flow and tiers

With `cache_key` unset, `orchestrate.load_lattice` is unchanged. With it set, the flow is:
read and validate the cache file (any failure yields an empty cache, section 7), then for each
discovered path:

1. **Stat tier**, only when `cache_trust_stat: true` and only for read-only commands: if
   `stats[current_root]` exists and matches the file's `(st_size, st_mtime_ns)`, use the entry
   without opening the file. The body comes from the entry. This tier carries the standard
   mtime caveat: a rewrite that preserves size and `mtime_ns` serves stale data until the file
   is touched. That caveat is why the tier is opt-in, why the default tier exists, and why the
   section 1 guarantee names it as the contract's one narrowing. `reconcile` never takes this
   tier: it plans the `seen` values it writes from the loaded snapshot, so a stale load would
   mutate frontmatter from stale content. The load entry point takes a flag (set only by the
   `reconcile` CLI path) that forces tier 2 regardless of config.
2. **Verify tier**, the default: read the raw bytes and hash them. On a `file_sha256` match,
   reuse the entry's parsed results, skipping UTF-8 decode, frontmatter split, YAML parse,
   pydantic validation, and TOC, slug, and span derivation, which is the dominant CPU cost.
   `stats[current_root]` is inserted or refreshed if absent or drifted (for example after
   `touch`), both to keep a later `cache_trust_stat` warm and because presence of the root key
   is what marks the entry as still claimed by this root (see reclamation below).
3. **Miss**: run today's full parse path (identical errors, identical warnings), then replace
   the entry: new `file_sha256`, `stats` reset to only the current root, new `node` payload.
   The miss path calls `derive_file_sections` exactly once, in `orchestrate`, and the one
   `FileSections` value feeds both the entry payload and `ParsedDoc.sections`, so
   `build_lattice` never re-derives what the cache is about to store.

Error parity is a hard requirement of the flow: the cached path stats and byte-reads files
that today's path only opens through `read_doc`, and every filesystem or decode failure on a
doc (a file deleted between discovery and stat, permissions, invalid UTF-8) must raise
`UnreadableDocError` with the same message an uncached read would produce. Section 8 restructures
`read_doc` so both paths share the identical error construction.

At the end of a successful load: the current root moves to the ledger tail, over-cap head roots
are evicted and scrubbed, and the file is atomically replaced (temp file in the same directory,
fsync, `os.replace`) if and only if something changed: an entry added, replaced, or dropped, a
stat inserted or refreshed, a presence claim withdrawn, or the ledger reordered or scrubbed. A fully warm repeat run from the same root
performs one cache read and zero cache writes. Two roots alternating runs will each rewrite the
file to reclaim the ledger tail; that bounded churn (at most one atomic rewrite per run) is
accepted deliberately, because weakening recency updates would make the LRU evict active
worktrees. If the load aborts on any error, no cache write happens at all.

Reclamation rides on the `stats` maps, whose root keys double as per-root presence claims. At
write time, the current root's key is removed from every entry whose path was not discovered
this run (this root no longer has that file), and any entry whose `stats` map becomes empty,
whether through presence removal or ledger-eviction scrubbing, is dropped from the cache. Every
retained entry is therefore claimed by at least one of the at most `MAX_STAT_ROOTS` ledger
roots, and the cache is bounded by the union of doc paths currently present across those live
roots, not by the union of every path ever observed. Deleted and renamed files are reclaimed as
each root next runs; an entry a sibling worktree still contains stays alive through that
sibling's claim, which is exactly the sharing property that makes pruning on one checkout's
whole view wrong. A format version bump still resets wholesale, and deleting the cache
directory is the manual reset.

`reconcile` is doubly protected: its load phase always uses the verify tier (section 5, tier
1), and its write phase already re-reads each downstream file fresh, bypassing the lattice
snapshot entirely. Its rewrites simply make those files miss on the next load.

## 6. Invalidation summary

- The content hash is the only validity authority. The verify tier proves it per run; the stat
  tier (read-only commands, opt-in) presumes it from an exact `(size, mtime_ns)` match under
  the documented caveat.
- Any miss replaces the entry and resets its `stats` to the current root.
- Reclamation is presence-based: a root's claim on an undiscovered path is withdrawn at write
  time, and an unclaimed entry is dropped (section 5).
- A `version` or `tool_version` mismatch, or any structural invalidity, discards the whole
  file (section 7).
- Config changes never require invalidation (relative-path keying, section 4).

## 7. Failure modes

- **Cache read**: file missing, unreadable, invalid JSON, wrong `version`, or failing schema
  validation (including `NodeMeta.model_validate` on an entry's `meta`) causes the whole cache
  to be treated as empty. Everything recomputes and the file is rewritten. Silent by design;
  per-entry salvage is not worth the code for a rare event.
- **Cache write**: an unwritable directory or a failed write emits one diagnostic line
  written directly to `sys.stderr` (not through the `warnings` machinery: a warning filter
  such as `PYTHONWARNINGS=error` can promote `warnings.warn` into an exception, which would
  make a cached invocation fail where an uncached one succeeds and break the section 1
  guarantee). The command result and exit code are unchanged. Reads stay silent; writes
  produce the diagnostic because a permanently unwritable cache means the accelerator is off
  and the user should know.
- **Concurrent runs** (several worktrees at once): atomic replace means a reader sees the old
  or the new file, never a torn one. Last writer wins; a lost update is only a future miss.

No new exception types are needed. The cache never raises on its own behalf; config validation
reuses `ConfigError`, and doc-level filesystem failures raise the same `UnreadableDocError` as
an uncached run (section 5).

Threat model: the cache file is same-user local state under the user's cache home and is
trusted as such, like any other dotfile; same-user tampering is out of scope. What the design
does defend is the committed config (no path semantics, section 3) and cross-project key
collisions (content-hash verification, section 4). The default tier re-proves every entry
against the real file bytes each run, so even a stale or foreign cache can only cost time.

## 8. Purity boundary and module changes

- **`cache.py` (new, impure)**: the only module that touches the cache. It computes the cache
  path from the environment, reads, validates, and atomically writes the file, owns the entry
  schema as pydantic models, and implements tier selection. It is wired only from
  `orchestrate.py`. It stays clean under `scripts/check_typing_boundaries.py`: raw
  `json.loads` output flows directly into `model_validate`, so the module needs no
  `typing.Any` and no `cast`.
- **`config.py`**: the two new fields and their validators.
- **`model.py`**: new frozen dataclasses `FileSections` (`total_lines: int`,
  `sections: tuple[SectionRecord, ...]`) and `SectionRecord` (`anchor: str`, `start: int`,
  `end: int`). `ParsedDoc` gains `sections: FileSections | None = None`.
- **`loader.py` (stays pure)**: the existing inline TOC, anchor, and span logic is extracted
  into `derive_file_sections(body) -> FileSections`; `build_lattice` uses `doc.sections` when
  present and derives it otherwise. This is the only pure-layer change and it is a seam, not
  behavior: cached and derived sections are the same values by construction, pinned by a
  property test (section 9).
- **`discovery.py`**: `read_doc` is split into a byte-reading helper and a decoding helper
  that construct the `UnreadableDocError` in one place; `read_doc` composes them and keeps its
  signature, and the cache path calls the same helpers (bytes for hashing, decode only on a
  miss). Stat failures in the tier checks route through the same error construction. This is
  what makes the section 5 error-parity requirement hold by construction instead of by
  duplicated message strings.
- **`orchestrate.py`**: the branch described in section 5; the no-cache path is unchanged
  code. `load_lattice` gains a keyword flag (`require_verified: bool = False`, named at
  implementation time) that disables the stat tier for the call; only the `reconcile` CLI
  path sets it.
- **`constants.py`**: `CACHE_VERSION`, `MAX_STAT_ROOTS`, and the cache file name.

`cache.py` resolves the cache home from an environment mapping passed by its caller
(defaulting to `os.environ`), so tests exercise XDG handling by argument rather than by
patching global state.

`model`, `sections`, `hashing`, `resolve`, and every command module are otherwise untouched,
and no pure module gains filesystem access.

## 9. Determinism guarantee and testing

The guarantee in section 1 is enforced by:

- **A hypothesis property test**: random edit sequences over a synthetic doc set (body edits,
  frontmatter edits, file add, delete, and rename, `touch` without content change, and a
  same-size same-`mtime_ns` rewrite). After each step, for every configuration the section 1
  guarantee covers (default tier always; trust_stat everywhere outside the one documented
  caveat), a cached and an uncached load must produce structurally equal `Lattice` values and
  byte-identical `check` output. The same-stat rewrite case asserts both halves of the
  narrowed contract: the read-only stale outcome under trust_stat is the documented behavior,
  and a `reconcile` load in the identical state still sees the fresh content (the forced
  verify tier), so no configuration can mutate files from stale data.
- **Round-trip property test**: for generated bodies, `derive_file_sections` equals the value
  reconstructed from its serialized cache form.
- **Unit tests**: each corruption mode (truncated file, invalid JSON, wrong `version`, wrong
  `tool_version`, schema violation, invalid `meta`) recomputes silently; a non-node hit performs no YAML parse
  (counting monkeypatch on the parser); per-root stats isolation across two roots; stats reset
  on content change; ledger LRU order, eviction at the cap, and scrubbing of evicted roots;
  presence reclamation (a path deleted in one root is dropped once no root claims it, and
  kept while a second root still claims it); fully warm run writes nothing; an injected write
  failure emits one stderr diagnostic, leaves no partial file, and preserves the command's
  result and exit code even with warnings configured as errors;
  `cache_key` validation accepts and rejects the right shapes; `cache_trust_stat`
  without `cache_key` is a `ConfigError`; `XDG_CACHE_HOME` absolute, relative, and unset
  handling; error parity (an invalid-UTF-8 doc and a doc deleted after discovery raise the
  same `UnreadableDocError` message with a warm cache as without one); and
  cached-versus-uncached CLI byte-equality for `check`, `impact`, `graph`, and `lint` on the
  shared `lattice_dir` fixture, plus `reconcile --all` on twin copies of the fixture tree
  (identical output and identical resulting file bytes, cached versus uncached).

The suite stays above the existing 80 percent coverage gate; new tests mirror sources as
`tests/test_cache.py` plus additions to the loader, config, and CLI suites.

## 10. Benchmark plan

`scripts/bench_load_cache.py` (dev-only, not shipped): generates a synthetic corpus at 1k and
5k docs with parameterized heading and edge counts, then reports the median of 5 runs of
`load_lattice` wall time in four states: uncached, cold cache (including the write), warm
verify tier, and warm stat tier. It also reports the cache file size and the share of warm-run
time spent in `json.loads`, which is the known cost of the single-file JSON format.

Acceptance threshold: the warm verify tier is at least 3x faster than uncached at 5k docs,
otherwise the feature is reconsidered before release. The measured numbers go in the
implementation PR description.

## 11. Alternatives considered

1. **SQLite storage**: indexed rows, partial IO, `user_version` pragma. Rejected: an opaque
   binary artifact in a deterministic, debuggable-text tool, more corruption modes, and more
   code for the same guarantee. The `version` field gives a clean migration path if the
   benchmark ever shows whole-file JSON parsing eating the win.
2. **One JSON entry file per doc**: trivially incremental writes. Rejected: thousands of tiny
   reads per run make the cache's own IO comparable to reading the docs.
3. **In-repo `cache_dir`** (the issue sketch): rejected for the worktree dilemma in section 3.
4. **`cache_dir` allowed to point outside the repo under a dual-root containment rule**:
   rejected; it puts path semantics and developer-specific paths into a committed config and
   needs a subtler containment rule than "one validated segment".
5. **Trusting stat by default with opt-in verification**: rejected; the issue's own priority
   is that invalidation correctness beats speed, so the exact tier is the default and the
   presumptive tier is the opt-in.
6. **Caching target hashes**: deferred with rationale in section 4.
7. **Pruning entries not discovered in the current run**: rejected; it evicts entries other
   worktrees still need. Superseded by per-root presence reclamation (section 5), which
   withdraws only the running root's own claim and drops an entry once no live root claims it.
8. **Keeping undiscovered entries forever**: rejected; the "bounded by the union across
   branches" claim was really the union of every path ever observed, so renames and deleted
   docs would retain full bodies indefinitely and grow the cache without bound.
9. **Age-based garbage collection of stat roots**: rejected; it needs a wall clock, against
   the repo's determinism posture, while the LRU ledger is deterministic given the run
   sequence (section 4).
10. **Removing the stat tier instead of scoping it**: considered when reconciling the tier
    with the correctness guarantee. Rejected in favor of scoping: read-only commands keep the
    opt-in speed tier under the documented caveat, and the one mutating command is barred from
    it, so file mutations stay under the absolute guarantee in every configuration.
11. **`warnings.warn` for the cache-write diagnostic**: rejected; warning filters can promote
    it to an exception, letting a broken cache fail a command that succeeds uncached
    (section 7).

## 12. Non-goals

Target-hash caching (v2 candidate), a `--no-cache` CLI flag, garbage collection beyond the
roots ledger and per-root presence reclamation, compression, per-entry corruption salvage,
watch mode, a daemon, and cross-machine cache sharing.

## 13. Documentation

The implementation PR updates: the README (config keys, cache location, the worktree
rationale, the shared-`cache_key` collision note, and the stat-tier caveat), `CHANGELOG.md`
under `[Unreleased]` as `Added`, and `init`'s config template with a commented-out
`# cache_key: my-project-docs` example. CLAUDE.md's module map gains `cache.py` on the impure
side.
