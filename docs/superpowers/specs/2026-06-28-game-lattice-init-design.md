# game-lattice Init Slice: Design Spec

**Date:** 2026-06-28
**Status:** Design (post brainstorm). Ready for implementation planning.
**Scope:** Onboarding ergonomics. One `init` command that scaffolds the project config and emits
pre-commit and CI codegen for an adopting repo. No network, no secrets, no LLM. The only new
disk-touching code is a single config write; the rest is printed.
**Builds on:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-27-game-lattice-local-core-design.md` (the local
core) and `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-27-game-lattice-linear-design.md` (the linear slice).

This spec turns the deferred `init` item from the local-core deferral map (section 12, "init
scaffolding, pre-commit and CI codegen") into a buildable design. It does not re-open any locked
decision from the local core. The local-core spec already states (section 7) that `init` will
scaffold `.game-lattice.yml` later and that the tool never depends on `init` having run; this slice
realizes that promise without changing how config is read.

## 1. Scope

In scope:

- A single `init` command that bootstraps a repo adopting game-lattice.
- It writes one file, `.game-lattice.yml`, when absent, and prints two codegen artifacts: a
  pre-commit hook and a GitHub Actions workflow, each of which runs `game-lattice check` as the
  drift gate.
- The config write is deterministic and templated, with two optional flags (`--docs-root`,
  repeatable, and `--linear-team`) that bake values into the generated file.
- The command is idempotent and re-runnable: with a config already present it leaves it untouched
  and still prints the codegen, so `init` doubles as a way to re-fetch the snippets.

Explicitly out of scope, deferred or declined (see section 11):

- Merging into or editing an existing `.pre-commit-config.yaml` or CI workflow. The command prints
  those two artifacts; it never mutates a file the adopting repo owns.
- Interactive prompts, `--json` output, a `--force` overwrite, a `--config` write-target override,
  and non-GitHub CI providers.
- Actually cutting the `v0.1.0` git tag. The snippets pin to a version tag; creating and pushing
  that tag is a user-performed release step this spec calls out (section 8), not automated here.

## 2. The mutation boundary

game-lattice keeps mutation narrow and deliberate. Today `reconcile` is the only command that
writes, and it writes surgically. This slice adds the second writing command, and draws its
boundary just as sharply so the careful-mutation posture is preserved:

- `init` writes exactly one file, `.game-lattice.yml`, and only when it does not already exist. It
  never overwrites it, never edits it, and never touches any other file on disk.
- The pre-commit and CI artifacts are codegen: printed to stdout for the user to place, never
  written. This is why the slice can scaffold a repo it knows nothing about without risking a file
  the adopter has hand-tuned.
- The spec's own wording splits the job this way: the config is "scaffolding" (written), the
  pre-commit and CI are "codegen" (printed). The command honors that split exactly.

## 3. Operating model and command surface

```
game-lattice init                                # write .game-lattice.yml (if absent), print codegen
game-lattice init --docs-root design --docs-root lore   # repeatable; sets docs_roots
game-lattice init --linear-team PC               # bakes linear_team into the written config
```

There is no `--json`, no `--force`, no `--config`, and no interactive prompt. The command's
behavior is fully determined by the two flags and whether a config already exists.

Streams are split so a captured run yields only the artifacts:

- stdout carries the two codegen snippets, each under a `#`-comment banner naming its destination
  file. Emitted with plain `typer.echo` (no rich markup) so the YAML pastes clean and stays valid.
- stderr carries narration: whether the config was written or skipped, where to paste each snippet,
  and the tag prerequisite from section 8.

So `game-lattice init > setup.yml` captures exactly the two snippets and nothing else.

## 4. Architecture

The slice extends the existing pure/impure split rather than bending it.

**Pure layer, new module `scaffold.py`** (filesystem-free, beside `render.py` and `reconcile.py`).
It generates three strings from typed inputs and returns them as a frozen value:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)
class Scaffold:
    config_text: str       # .game-lattice.yml
    precommit_text: str    # the repo: local hook snippet
    ci_text: str           # the GitHub Actions workflow

def build_scaffold(
    docs_roots: tuple[str, ...], linear_team: str | None, rev: str
) -> Scaffold: ...
```

`rev` is injected by the caller, never read inside the module, so `scaffold` stays pure and is
tested against arbitrary revs. The repository URL is a single module constant
`GAME_LATTICE_REPO_URL = "https://github.com/Guardantix/game-lattice"` (the SSH remote rewritten to
the https git form `uvx` needs), referenced by both snippet renderers so the literal is never
duplicated.

**Impure layer, `init` command in `cli.py`** (the only new disk-touching code). It computes
`rev = f"v{__version__}"`, builds the scaffold, writes the config when absent through the existing
`_atomic_write`, and prints the codegen. It follows the same `ProjectError -> exit 2` handling every
other command uses.

This keeps `scaffold` testable with no I/O, exactly as `render` and `reconcile.reconcile` are.

## 5. Command behavior

1. Resolve inputs: `rev = f"v{__version__}"`; `docs_roots = tuple(--docs-root) or ("docs",)`;
   `linear_team` from the flag or `None`.
2. Validate `--docs-root` values syntactically: reject any entry that is absolute or contains a
   `..` segment, with the same message style `config._resolve_roots` uses. This is a pure,
   filesystem-free guard so `init` never writes a config guaranteed to fail loading. Full
   containment resolution still happens later when the config is loaded; this is only the early,
   obvious-case check.
3. Build the scaffold (pure).
4. Config write to `cwd/.game-lattice.yml`:
   - If it exists: leave it untouched, note the skip on stderr.
   - If absent: atomic-write `scaffold.config_text`, note the write on stderr.
5. Print the codegen to stdout: the pre-commit snippet then the CI snippet, each under a `#`-comment
   banner naming its destination file.
6. Print placement guidance and the tag caveat (section 8) to stderr.
7. Exit 0 on success. A `ProjectError` (for example an unwritable directory surfaced as a project
   error) exits 2, consistent with the other commands. `init` never reports drift, so it never
   exits 1.

## 6. The three artifacts

### 6.1 `.game-lattice.yml` (written)

The active keys reflect the flags; the remaining optional keys appear as commented examples the
user can uncomment. With no flags:

```yaml
# game-lattice configuration. See https://github.com/Guardantix/game-lattice
docs_roots:
  - docs
# ignore_globs:
#   - "**/superpowers/plans/**"
# linear_team: my-team-slug
# binding_layers: null
```

`--docs-root design --docs-root lore` replaces the `docs_roots` list with `design` and `lore`.
`--linear-team PC` turns the commented `linear_team` line into an active `linear_team: PC`.

The generated text must round-trip through the real `Config` pydantic model. A test loads the
generated file through `load_config` and asserts the resulting `Config`, so the template can never
drift from the schema (`extra="forbid"` would catch a stray key).

### 6.2 pre-commit hook (printed)

Added by the user under `repos:` in their `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: game-lattice-check
        name: game-lattice check
        entry: uvx --from git+https://github.com/Guardantix/game-lattice@v0.1.0 game-lattice check
        language: system
        files: \.md$
        pass_filenames: false
```

`language: system` runs the entry as given (it needs `uvx` on PATH, which the uv toolchain
provides). `files: \.md$` triggers the hook when markdown changes; `pass_filenames: false` because
`check` evaluates the whole lattice, not the individual changed files.

### 6.3 CI workflow (printed)

Saved by the user as `.github/workflows/game-lattice.yml`:

```yaml
name: game-lattice
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  check:
    name: Traceability check
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v6
      - run: uvx --from git+https://github.com/Guardantix/game-lattice@v0.1.0 game-lattice check
```

`check` exits 0 on a clean lattice, 1 on drift, and 2 on a tool error; the job fails on 1 or 2,
which is exactly the gate this is meant to provide. Only `check` runs. `linear` is deliberately
excluded from the generated CI: it needs a token and network, which are out of scope for an
onboarding default.

## 7. Invocation model

Both snippets invoke game-lattice through `uvx --from git+<url>@<rev> game-lattice check`. This is
zero-install: `uv` fetches and runs the pinned revision on demand, adds no dependency to the
adopter's project, and works identically in pre-commit and GitHub Actions. It fits because `uv` is
already the toolchain and there is no PyPI release to install from.

## 8. Versioning prerequisite

The snippets pin `@v{__version__}`, which is `@v0.1.0` for the current version. No release tags
exist yet, so the generated snippets resolve only once `v0.1.0` is tagged and pushed. This slice
therefore carries one user-performed companion action, stated here so it is a conscious step rather
than a surprise:

- Establish the `vX.Y.Z` release-tag convention and push `v0.1.0` (and each subsequent version),
  so that `uvx --from git+...@vX.Y.Z` resolves for consumers.

The code is version-agnostic: it reads `__version__` and pins `v{__version__}`, so future versions
need no code change, only the matching tag. The slice documents this expectation with a short note
in the README or release docs; it does not add release tooling or cut the tag automatically.

## 9. Conventions and invariants

- `scaffold.py` is a pure typed module: no `typing.Any`, no `typing.cast` (it is not a `_parser`
  boundary module). String building only.
- The repo URL is centralized as one constant and referenced from every renderer that needs it
  (both snippets and the config header); no duplicated literal.
- No `datetime` use: the artifacts carry no timestamps.
- Module docstring on `scaffold.py`; Google-style docstrings on `build_scaffold` and the `init`
  command. No em-dashes in docstrings, messages, or comments.
- Paths: `init` writes the fixed filename `.game-lattice.yml` into the current working directory; it
  is not a user-provided path, so it does not need `safe_resolve`. The `--docs-root` values are
  written as text, not resolved at init time; section 5 step 2 gives them a syntactic guard.

## 10. Testing

- `tests/test_scaffold.py` (pure, no I/O):
  - default `docs_roots` yields `docs` active with the optional keys commented;
  - `--docs-root` overrides produce the listed roots; `--linear-team` produces an active
    `linear_team` line;
  - `rev` is interpolated into both snippets, alongside the repo URL;
  - the generated `config_text` round-trips through the real `Config` model.
- `tests/test_cli.py` (extend, using `tmp_path`):
  - `init` in an empty directory writes `.game-lattice.yml` with the expected content and prints
    both snippets to stdout, exit 0;
  - `init` with a config already present does not change the file but still prints both snippets,
    notes the skip on stderr, exit 0;
  - `--docs-root` and `--linear-team` bake their values into the written file;
  - stdout carries both destination banners and the pinned `@v0.1.0`;
  - an absolute or `..`-bearing `--docs-root` is rejected before any write.
- `tests/test_conventions.py` stays green (new module obeys the typing-boundary and docstring
  rules). Coverage stays at or above the existing 80 percent gate.

## 11. Non-goals and deferral map

| Deferred or declined item | Disposition |
|---|---|
| Merging into an existing `.pre-commit-config.yaml` or CI workflow | declined; print, never edit a file the adopter owns |
| Interactive prompts | declined; non-deterministic, fights the offline/CI posture |
| `--json`, `--force`, `--config` write target | declined; YAGNI for an onboarding command |
| Non-GitHub CI providers | out of scope; GitHub Actions only, matching this repo |
| Cutting and pushing the `v0.1.0` tag | user-performed release step (section 8), not automated |
| Authority-ladder validation, display-prefix lint | still deferred by the local-core map; unrelated to init |

## 12. Acceptance

| Goal | Solved by | Verifiable when |
|---|---|---|
| Onboarding a repo | `init` writes a valid config and prints both gate snippets | a fresh directory gains a loadable `.game-lattice.yml` and copy-paste pre-commit and CI in one command |
| Safe re-run | skip-and-continue on an existing config | re-running `init` never alters a hand-tuned config yet still prints the codegen |
| Reproducible gate | `uvx ... @v{__version__}` pinning | the generated pre-commit and CI both pin the same version that generated them |
