# Allowlist recognizer decision record (issue #100)

Date: 2026-07-20 (decision recorded; the evaluation spec is dated 2026-07-19)

Status: decision record for the issue #100 allowlist recognizer evaluation. This document is
non-authoritative. Durable user behavior transfers to [README.md](../../../README.md), durable
decisions to [ARCHITECTURE.md](../../../ARCHITECTURE.md), and release history to
[CHANGELOG.md](../../../CHANGELOG.md) when PR B lands.

Issue: <https://github.com/Guardantix/doc-lattice/issues/100>

Spec: [2026-07-19-allowlist-recognizer-design.md](2026-07-19-allowlist-recognizer-design.md)

Baseline for all accounting in this record: commit `00737ca`.

## 1. Verdict

The D3 floor-grammar candidate is REJECTED by predeclared gate 6: candidate indeterminate 3 of
20 against a budget of 2, and newly indeterminate 3 of 20 against a budget of 2 (fixtures 02,
05, and 14: a command substitution with a pipe, a function definition, and a literal `${{ }}`
template). Per the spec's failure path, only durable corpus, harness, results, and decision
evidence merge; the evaluation implementation stays in the merged harness as the dormant
`reachability.py`, `launcher_policy.py`, and `direct_marker_scanner.py` modules, which land in
the branch's implementation commits, with their reviewed evaluation state pinned here by commit
`bfc1f46`. The evaluation advances the parser-backed candidate (`mvdan/sh` family first), scoped
in section 6.

## 2. Gate results

Every gate ran under both supported Python versions (3.13 and 3.14). Gates 1 through 5, 7, 8,
and the CI half of 9 are pytest-enforced; the wall-clock half of gate 9 is the trusted
fleetyard-only decision gate. Gates 1 through 5, 7, 8, and 9 pass; gate 6 fails by construction,
and that recorded failure is the verdict above.

| Gate | Budget | Measured result | Outcome |
|------|--------|-----------------|---------|
| 1. Corpus relabel | Every one of the 78 acceptance cases conforms to its checkpoint label and expected `BlockScan`. | 78 of 78 conform: 7 must-certify, 65 intentional-exit-2, 6 outside-direct-marker-contract. | Pass |
| 2. Frozen replay inventory | Zero divergence outside categories (a) identical, (b) intentional exit 2, (c) outside direct-marker contract; category (d) empty absent a prelabeled exception. | 613 records (580 inventory, 13 Tier 3A, 20 Tier 3B): identical 266, intentional-exit-2 321, outside-direct-marker 26, unexplained 0, category (d) 0. | Pass |
| 3. Tier 1, managed workflows | The rendered offline template's PR block certifies with its exact invocations; zero diagnostics. | Certified with invocations `(ci, false)`, `(check, false)`, `(lint, false)`; zero diagnostics. | Pass |
| 4. Tier 2, this repository | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` reports zero diagnostics and zero findings. | The `release` job is pruned under D1; every PR-reachable block is not applicable under D2; zero diagnostics. | Pass |
| 5. Tier 3A, documented conformance | 0 unexpected indeterminates over the documented invocation shapes. | 13 of 13 conform (11 certified, 2 uninspectable); 0 unexpected indeterminates. | Pass |
| 6. Tier 3B, empirical envelopes | Candidate indeterminate at most 2 of 20; newly indeterminate at most 2 of 20; false-safe exactly 0; false positives exactly 0. | Candidate indeterminate 3 of 20 and newly indeterminate 3 of 20 (fixtures 02, 05, 14); false-safe 0; false positives 0. Both indeterminate budgets breach. | Fail (recorded rejection) |
| 7. Semantic differential | Every layer agrees against the independent oracle. | Static layer 35 of 35 (`bash -n` plus shfmt structure), span reproduction 36 of 36, probe execution under pinned Bash 5.2.21(1)-release 36 of 36, boundary mutations 50 of 50. | Pass |
| 8. Adversarial and bounds | Cap exhaustion and malformed tails produce deterministic `uninspectable` within bounds. | 9 adversarial inputs, each deterministic across repeated scans and within the work bound. | Pass |
| 9. Complexity and performance | CI half: `work <= min(4,194,304, 4 * input_length + 4,096)` for every input. Trusted half: each version's median at or under the 250 ms ceiling. | CI half: 622 sources (580 inventory, 13 Tier 3A, 20 Tier 3B, 9 adversarial) all within bound. Trusted half (fleetyard, inventory 580): median 29.384 ms on CPython 3.13.14 and 25.302 ms on 3.14.6 against the 250 ms ceiling; candidate-to-baseline ratios 0.501 and 0.448. | Pass |

Benchmark methodological caveat. The fleetyard timings above ran under ambient
interactive-desktop load (one-minute load average roughly 6 to 8.5 on 8 logical cores, from
steady-state Cinnamon, XRDP, and wezterm overhead, not a competing batch workload). That load
biases the timings slower and noisier, the conservative direction. With the medians landing
roughly 8.5x (3.13) and 9.9x (3.14) under the 250 ms ceiling, it could not flip the verdict, but
the absolute numbers should not be read as idle-machine timings.

## 3. Contract removals

The D2 direct-marker gating replaces the previous notion of "direct invocation" with a
"direct-marker contract". Two named contract removals follow. Both are reported separately in
every benchmark result and are never silently reclassified as safe.

1. Marker-free constructed executable names, for example `doc-"lattice" linear` (currently
   accepted, `tests/test_github_ci_shell_scanner.py:31`). This is a deliberate contraction from
   "direct invocation" to the new "direct-marker contract", a compatibility and security
   reduction.
2. Marker-free dynamically selected launcher payloads, for example `uvx "$PKG" ...`. This case
   is already within the issue's declared dynamic and indirect exclusion; the gate makes it
   explicit.

## 4. Predeclaration integrity

The predeclaration checkpoint landed as commit `7d1d2b2` (`test: land issue #100 predeclaration
checkpoint`), PR A's first reviewed commit and the boundary that makes "inputs chosen first"
independently auditable. The checkpoint carries two owner-adjudicated amendments: the
insert-check substitution for the gate 7 boundary mutations, and the replay-inventory recapture
that grew the frozen inventory from 550 to 580 entries.

No checkpoint file changed after the freeze. `test_manifest_matches_artifacts`
([tests/test_github_ci_checkpoint.py](../../../tests/test_github_ci_checkpoint.py)) runs
`scripts/checkpoint_manifest.py --check` against the SHA-256
[MANIFEST.sha256](../../../tests/fixtures/github_ci_checkpoint/MANIFEST.sha256), which is the
auditable proof of that immutability.

## 5. Replacement-surface accounting

Symbol- and diff-based accounting against baseline `00737ca`, not line-range arithmetic. The
three new dormant modules:

| Module | Lines | Public symbols |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| [reachability.py](../../../src/doc_lattice/github_ci/reachability.py) | 98 | 1: `job_is_pr_reachable` |
| [launcher_policy.py](../../../src/doc_lattice/github_ci/launcher_policy.py) | 418 | 3: `ScanWord`, `CandidateResolution`, `resolve_command` |
| [direct_marker_scanner.py](../../../src/doc_lattice/github_ci/direct_marker_scanner.py) | 569 | 2: `scan_execution_source`, `certified_command_words` |

Total: 6 public symbols across 1,085 module lines.

`git diff --stat 00737ca...HEAD -- src/doc_lattice` reports 5 files changed and 1,181 insertions,

`model.py` gains `AuditDiagnostic` and `AuditResult` plus the `BlockScan` result type; `constants.py`
gains the status, reason-category, and diagnostic-code domains under the `Literal` plus
`get_args()` plus `frozenset` pattern. No production line of
`src/doc_lattice/github_ci/shell_scanner.py` changed in PR A; it is absent from the diff and
remains the runtime scanner until PR B.

Known limitation, dormant module. The work-counter helper `_advance_to` in
[direct_marker_scanner.py](../../../src/doc_lattice/github_ci/direct_marker_scanner.py) charges a
multi-character span in one call to `_WorkCounter.charge` but does not inspect that call's
within-budget return value, so a jump that crosses the work limit is not detected at the crossing
offset, only at the next `over()` check. The total charge is still accrued, so the meter cannot
undercount; the gap is confined to the offset at which an overrun would be reported. It is real
but unobserved on the corpus: every corpus source finished with an observed work margin of at
least 4,114 units below the limit, so no source approached the crossing. Recorded here as a
known, bounded limitation of the dormant module so it is not rediscovered from scratch.

## 6. Parser-backed candidate scoping

Per the issue thread and its review comments, the successor is a doc-lattice-owned static helper
built directly on an exactly pinned `mvdan.cc/sh/v3` syntax API (`LangBash`, source supplied on
stdin, with a doc-lattice-owned IR as the only production protocol). The reflection-derived typed
JSON is acceptable for the differential oracles only, never as the production protocol.

The successor evaluation requires its own spec revision and a fresh predeclaration checkpoint.
The Tier 3B corpus and this harness are reusable, but every expected outcome must be re-derived
under the successor grammar before any successor code runs.

## 7. Evidence

- Archived July 2026 bash-parser benchmark:
  [docs/research/2026-07-bash-parser-benchmark/](../../research/2026-07-bash-parser-benchmark/),
  with per-file SHA-256 hashes and provenance in
  [PROVENANCE.md](../../research/2026-07-bash-parser-benchmark/PROVENANCE.md), labeled "internally
  consistent, not independently reproducible". Audited totals (correct / false-safe /
  indeterminate / false-positive over 234 executions): shfmt 3.13.1 = 69/1/8/0, tree-sitter-bash
  0.25.1 = 58/5/14/1, bashlex 0.18 = 40/12/25/1. These artifacts are evidence for this record and
  are never gate inputs.
- Fleetyard benchmark JSON:
  [py313.json](../../research/recognizer-benchmark/py313.json) and
  [py314.json](../../research/recognizer-benchmark/py314.json), the trusted-half medians, ratios,
  and ceiling recorded in the gate 9 row above.
- Frozen predeclaration checkpoint:
  [tests/fixtures/github_ci_checkpoint/](../../../tests/fixtures/github_ci_checkpoint/), with its
  SHA-256 [MANIFEST.sha256](../../../tests/fixtures/github_ci_checkpoint/MANIFEST.sha256).
- Gate automation:
  [test_github_ci_evaluation_gates.py](../../../tests/test_github_ci_evaluation_gates.py) and
  [test_github_ci_semantic_differential.py](../../../tests/test_github_ci_semantic_differential.py).

## 8. Release freeze

PR A bumps nothing; it lands this record and the archived evidence and changes no version
surface. The next release stays frozen until the successor evaluation lands a decision and PR B
ships the integration, per the spec's Delivery and Release sections.
