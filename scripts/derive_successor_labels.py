"""Re-derive successor-grammar labels for the 87-row Bash acceptance corpus (spec S8, gate 1).

The successor certifier is a real Bash parser (mvdan.cc/sh/v3) walked by the frozen
certified-construct table. This script starts from the frozen D3 acceptance labels for the
78-row prefix and from the live shell-scanner expectation for the post-#103 appendix, then
applies the spec successor deltas (S3.1, S3.2, S3.4, S5.3, S6.1, S6.2, S6.3, S6.5) row by row.

Each row's successor outcome is the judgment recorded in ``_DECISIONS``; the accompanying
``delta`` tag names the driving rule and ``derivation`` states why. The script writes the
checkpoint corpus artifact and a human-readable relabel report, and prints label and delta
counts. It is deterministic: identical inputs produce byte-identical output.

The 2026-07-21 owner ratifications from the Tier 3B predeclaration adjudication are folded in:
the ``(Assign, value)`` traverse ratification flips row 10 (assignment-only substitution) to
must-certify, and the S5.2 literal-assignment-prefix ratification (certify commands whose only
assignment prefixes carry statically known literal values) was evaluated against every row and
flips none, because no acceptance row carries a literal-assignment-prefix-plus-argv marker
command; the sole assignment refusal in the corpus is row 10, already resolved by the value
traverse.
