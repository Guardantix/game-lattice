"""Section span and text utilities over the versioned Markdown adapter.

Section-span semantics are adapted from gx-linear-skills' binding_slicer: a section
spans from its heading line through the line before the next heading of equal or higher
level, or to end of file. Heading extraction and slug generation live in
``markdown_compat`` so their upstream compatibility boundary remains explicit.
