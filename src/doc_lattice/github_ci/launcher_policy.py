"""doc-lattice launcher, option, and subcommand policy over the shared word IR.

This module owns the deterministic recognition floor for doc-lattice invocations that a shell
scanner discovers in GitHub CI execution sources. It exposes the shared word intermediate
representation (``ScanWord``) and a single pure entry point, ``resolve_command``, that
classifies one command's words into a ``CandidateResolution``.

The dependency direction is policy-first and permanent: the scanner imports this module and
never the reverse, so this module must not import the scanner. The semantics adapt
``shell_scanner.py`` to a deliberately narrower floor; where that reference is more permissive,
this contract wins.
