## Owner-adjudicate rows (10)

These rows are not fully determined by the frozen contracts and carry a
fail-closed proposal for Rick's checkpoint review.

- Row 1 (concatenated quoted words): proposed outside-direct-marker-contract. D2 gates on authored raw text, and the concatenation doc-"lattice" carries no doc[-_.]+lattice marker in that raw text, so the source is dropped at collection (S5.1) before any helper runs. The S6.2 ordering clarification confirms the word-level marker rule never resurrects a source D2 did not batch, so the doc-quote contraction stays a named D2 contract removal ratified in the predecessor evaluation. This restores the D3 checkpoint's not_applicable disposition for this row.
- Row 32 (arithmetic command shift): proposed intentional-exit-2. S3.2 ArithmCmd (( )) is a refuse construct; unsupported-construct is fixed terminal scope in the frozen reason-code table, but the table does not fix which code an ArithmCmd refusal emits, deciding whether the sibling doc-lattice linear is retained. Proposed fail-closed: terminal, no retained invocation.
- Row 37 (unbalanced dollar-arithmetic runs a command-substitution subshell): proposed intentional-exit-2. S3.2 Assign value is refuse and the $(( )) fallback to a command-substitution subshell is parser-behavior dependent; fail-closed intentional-exit-2 drops the old-scanner linear.
- Row 38 (unbalanced arithmetic command runs a nested subshell): proposed intentional-exit-2. Whether mvdan/sh parses (( )) as an ArithmCmd refuse or as a nested subshell traverse is parser-behavior dependent; fail-closed intentional-exit-2 drops the old-scanner linear.
- Row 49 (unquoted heredoc delimiter word removes continuation): proposed intentional-exit-2. S3.4 flags the backslash-newline continuation in the heredoc delimiter word; whether the guard fires is parser-behavior dependent. Proposed fail-closed: guard refusal.
- Row 50 (double-quoted heredoc delimiter word removes continuation): proposed intentional-exit-2. S3.4 flags the backslash-newline continuation in the double-quoted delimiter word; parser-behavior dependent. Proposed fail-closed: guard refusal.
- Row 61 (unquoted heredoc continuation forms command substitution): proposed intentional-exit-2. S3.4 body backslash-newline continuation that forms a command substitution; guard-versus-certify is parser-behavior dependent. Proposed fail-closed: guard refusal, dropping old linear.
- Row 62 (here-string substitution): proposed must-certify. S3.2 traverses the here-string word as a redirect target-word expansion; the command substitution executes and doc-lattice linear certifies. Proposal: here-string word mapped to Redirect target-word-expansion traverse; frozen table lacks an explicit here-string row; ratify the mapping or add the row.
- Row 63 (here-string literal): proposed must-certify. The here-string word is literal; cat is not a candidate and the source certifies empty. Proposal: here-string word mapped to Redirect target-word-expansion traverse; frozen table lacks an explicit here-string row; ratify the mapping or add the row.
- Row 71 (dry-run is here-string redirection word): proposed must-certify. The --dry-run word is the here-string redirect word (target-word expansion), not an argv token; reconcile certifies without dry-run. Proposal: here-string word mapped to Redirect target-word-expansion traverse; frozen table lacks an explicit here-string row; ratify the mapping or add the row.
