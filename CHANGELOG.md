# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Version-consistency guard (`scripts/check_version_sync.py`, pure core `version_check.py`) wired into pre-commit and CI: `__version__`, `pyproject.toml`, and the top `CHANGELOG.md` entry must agree.
- Merge-triggered `release` CI job that creates and verifies the lightweight `vX.Y.Z` tag, smoke-testing `check`, `lint`, and `init` against the pinned ref.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- `lint` command: validates the authority ladder over `derives_from` edges and reports edges it cannot rank.
- Generated pre-commit and CI now run both `game-lattice check` and `game-lattice lint`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added

- `init` command: scaffolds `.game-lattice.yml` and prints pre-commit and CI codegen for an adopting repo.
- `RELEASING.md`: release checklist that makes the version tag an atomic part of cutting a release.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- Initial project scaffolding
